'''
There are three methods to calculate the closeness between two users
on their likeness.
1) Manhattan or Euclidean (i.e.. minkowski in general) should be used
If your data is dense (almost all attributes have nonzero values)
and the magnitude of the attribute values is important
2) If the data is subject to grade-inï¬‚ation (different users
may be using different scales) use Pearson.
3) If the data is sparse (i.e.. if mostly zero values)
consider using Cosine Similarity.
